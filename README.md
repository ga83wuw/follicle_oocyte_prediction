# Follicle-Oocyte Ratio and its Contribution of a Healthy Oocyte Maturation

## Overview
We propose a deep learning method to segment the areas of oocytes and follicles in a follicle image database. 
We utilize a pair of deep learning CNNs to segment the areas, while using some pre-processing and post-processing techniques to enhance the results. 
Then, we use the areas computed along with other data available for these follicles, to build a model for predicting a limited number of them to be used for maturation. 
The goal is to select the most likely promising follicles, while we are also studying the effect of the ratio oocyte-follicle to the final outcome. 
That way we can provide the experts with a tool for an automatic and safe follicle selection for human treatment in assisted reproductive technologies.
